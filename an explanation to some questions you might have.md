Q: why is it not a github fork?

A: i make it an actual repo instead of a fork bc it doesnt put that much restrictions on me.

Q: why is there no branch that tracks EdgeIY/infiniteyield?

A: because im lazy to make it lol. also bc i dont feel like setting up a github actions thing to automate this process
