Q: why is it not a github fork?

A: i make it an actual repo instead of a fork bc it doesnt put that much restrictions on me.


Q: why is there no branch that tracks EdgeIY/infiniteyield?

A: because im lazy to make it lol. also bc i dont feel like setting up a github actions thing to automate this process

Q: why are you such an idiot?

A: can't do nuthin about it, sorry.

<!-- an actual answer: because i am, and, also, partly because im undereducated and mostly put my time into videogames/programming instead of school.
     just the usual 14yo problems, y'know?-->
